The standard form of a quadratic equation is:
ax2 + bx + c = 0, where
a, b and c are real numbers and
a â‰  0

# this program will calculate quadratic equation

# calculate the discriminant
d = (b ** 2) - (4 * a * c)

# find two solutions

sol1 = (-b - cmath.sqrt(d))/(2 * a)
sol2 = (-b + cmath.sqrt(d))/(2 * a)
